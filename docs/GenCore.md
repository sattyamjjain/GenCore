# GenCore: Physical Health Assistant

## Project Overview
The **Physical Health Assistant** is an AI-powered platform designed to assist healthcare professionals, physical trainers, and patients by providing personalized health insights, recovery recommendations, and fitness plans. Leveraging the power of generative AI, vector embeddings, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this tool helps users with evidence-based responses to queries related to physical health, injury prevention, rehabilitation, and fitness routines.

## Project Scope
The primary goal of the Physical Health Assistant is to integrate advanced AI models with real-world physical health data to provide actionable insights. It focuses on three main areas:
1. **Injury Recovery**: Offer tailored recovery plans and rehabilitation routines.
2. **Fitness and Exercise**: Generate personalized workout plans and advice based on user fitness goals.
3. **Physical Health Queries**: Provide accurate answers to specific questions about physical health, recovery, and fitness.

## Core Features

### 1. Health Data Ingestion
- **Objective**: Ingest and process various sources of physical health data, such as research papers, clinical guidelines, fitness assessments, and injury recovery protocols.
- **Sources**:
  - Publicly available research datasets (e.g., physical therapy guidelines, injury recovery protocols).
  - Integration with fitness trackers and health data APIs.
  - Manual data upload (e.g., PDFs or CSVs containing patient reports or fitness assessments).

### 2. Vector Search and Embeddings
- **Objective**: Use embedding models to convert physical health documents into searchable vectors for efficient retrieval of relevant information.
- **Tools**: 
  - Pre-trained embedding models from Hugging Face or OpenAI.
  - Vector databases such as **Pinecone**, **Chroma**, or **Weaviate** for fast document retrieval.

### 3. Personalized Health Recommendations (RAG)
- **Objective**: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized recommendations based on the user's input and health data.
  - **Example**: A user can query "How should I recover from a sprained ankle?" and receive evidence-based recovery steps and guidelines.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Users can ask questions about injuries, fitness, or recovery.
  - The system retrieves relevant data from the vector database and generates contextually accurate responses using pre-trained generative models.

### 4. Fitness and Injury Q&A
- **Objective**: Build a fine-tuned language model trained on fitness and injury data to provide accurate and context-aware answers to physical health queries.
- **Example Queries**:
  - "What exercises help in building core strength?"
  - "How do I recover from a torn hamstring?"
- **Customization**: Fine-tune a language model such as GPT-4 using domain-specific data related to injury recovery, fitness plans, and physical health.

### 5. Summarization of Research and Guidelines
- **Objective**: Summarize long and complex medical or fitness research papers into digestible insights.
  - **Example**: Summarizing the results of a clinical trial on the efficacy of physical therapy for knee injuries.
- **Benefits**: Enables healthcare professionals to quickly grasp key takeaways from research papers or fitness guidelines, improving decision-making.

### 6. Interactive User Interface
- **Objective**: Provide a web-based platform that allows users to:
  - Input their fitness goals, injury details, or physical health queries.
  - Upload reports or assessments to receive actionable insights.
- **User Categories**:
  - **Patients**: Receive personalized advice on injury recovery and rehabilitation.
  - **Doctors/Physiotherapists**: Retrieve research papers and create customized recovery plans.
  - **Trainers**: Generate fitness plans and track progress.
  
### 7. API Integration
- **Objective**: Provide an API layer that allows other applications to integrate with the platform for real-time health insights and recommendations.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Integrate with EHRs (Electronic Health Records) for hospitals.
  - Fitness apps can integrate to deliver tailored workout plans.

## Technical Architecture
